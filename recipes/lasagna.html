        <h2>Description</h2>
        <P>To make a classic lasagna, start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large pan, 
            heat olive oil and sauté diced onions and minced garlic until soft and fragrant. Add ground 
            beef, cooking until browned, then stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, dried 
            basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for 15–20 minutes. While the sauce cooks, 
            boil lasagna noodles according to package instructions, then drain and set aside. In a bowl, mix 
            ricotta cheese, an egg, half of the mozzarella, Parmesan, and fresh parsley or basil. To assemble the 
            lasagna, spread a thin layer of meat sauce in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place a layer of noodles on top, 
            followed by a layer of the ricotta mixture, then more meat sauce. Repeat the layers, finishing 
            with a final layer of meat sauce and the remaining mozzarella on top. Cover with foil and bake 
            for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake an additional 15 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly. 
            Let it rest for 10–15 minutes before serving. </P>
