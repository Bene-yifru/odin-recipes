        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Derek Tibs is a popular Ethiopian dish that features cubes of beef or lamb 
            that are pan-seared until crispy on the outside while maintaining a tender 
            and juicy interior. The meat is typically seasoned with a blend of traditional 
            Ethiopian spices, including berbere (a spicy chili powder blend), salt, and 
            sometimes fresh rosemary or thyme for added flavor. The dish is often cooked 
            in a hot, cast-iron skillet or pan, which helps to achieve its characteristic sear. 
            Derek Tibs is usually served with injera, a spongy sourdough flatbread, which acts 
            as both a plate and a utensil for scooping up the flavorful meat. Onions, jalapeños, 
            and sometimes tomatoes are sautéed alongside the meat, adding a balance of heat and
             freshness to the dish. It’s a simple, yet flavorful dish that is commonly enjoyed 
             as a main course or as part of a larger meal during celebrations and gatherings.

            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Fresh Rosemary or thyme (optional)</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Jalepenos</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the ingredients: Cube the beef or lamb into bite-sized pieces and slice the onions, jalapeños, and tomatoes (if using). Set everything aside.</li>
            <li>Season the meat: In a bowl, toss the cubed meat with salt and berbere spice to evenly coat the meat with the seasoning.</li>
            <li>Heat the pan: Heat a cast-iron skillet or pan over medium-high heat. Add a little olive oil or niter kibbeh (Ethiopian spiced butter) to the pan.</li>
            <li>Sear the meat: Once the pan is hot, add the seasoned meat in a single layer. Let the meat sear for about 3–4 minutes on each side until browned and crispy. Avoid stirring too much to get a good sear.</li>
            <li>Sauté the vegetables: After the meat is seared, push it to one side of the pan. Add the sliced onions, jalapeños, and tomatoes (if using) to the other side of the pan. Sauté the vegetables for about 2–3 minutes until they soften and develop a slight char.</li>
            <li>Combine and cook: Stir the meat and vegetables together in the pan. If desired, add fresh rosemary or thyme for added flavor. Continue cooking for another 2–3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>Serve: Remove from heat and serve the Derek Tibs hot, along with injera. You can use the injera to scoop up the meat and vegetables.</li>
