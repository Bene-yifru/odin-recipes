        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>To make a delicious Chicken Alfredo pasta, start by cooking fettuccine 
        noodles according to package instructions and set them aside. Meanwhile, 
        season boneless, skinless chicken breasts with salt and pepper, then cook 
        them in olive oil over medium heat until browned and cooked through. 
        Remove the chicken from the pan and slice it into strips. In the same pan, melt 
        butter and sauté minced garlic until fragrant. Stir in heavy cream, bringing it 
        to a simmer before adding grated Parmesan cheese, stirring until smooth and creamy. 
        Season the sauce with salt, pepper, and optional red pepper flakes for a bit of spice. 
        Add the cooked fettuccine to the sauce and toss to coat. Serve the pasta topped with the 
        sliced chicken and garnish with fresh parsley and extra Parmesan. 
        Enjoy this creamy, flavorful dish with garlic bread or a side salad for a complete meal!</p>
